After forking and cloning this repository,

1. Run `npm run install-all` in the project root to install all dependencies.
   -  If you are on Windows, use `npm run install-windows`.
   -  If neither works, you will have to run `npm install` or `npm i` in root, client(frontend), and server(backend) directories.
2. Run `npm run dev` to start a local dev server on [port 3000](http://localhost:3000). It will watch for changes and rebuild when you edit files in `src/` or `public/` directories. Note that rebuilding doesn't happen instantaneously so be patient for changes to appear. Use <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> to kill it.
